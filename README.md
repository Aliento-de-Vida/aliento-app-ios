## Architecture

 - This app is written following the [Clean Architecture](https://tech.olx.com/clean-architecture-and-mvvm-on-ios-c9d167d9f5b3) standard. It
   contains a data, domain and presentation layers.  
 - It uses [Resolver](https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver) for Dependency Injections and MVC with UIKit as Architecture Design Pattern.  
 - The app also contains dark and light theme using the [Material Design 2](https://m3.material.io/) Colors for the Design System.
 - [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for network requests.
 - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Analytics and Crashlytics.
 - Swift Package Manager and Cocoapods.

### Repository

The app uses the [Repository Pattern](https://medium.com/tiendeo-tech/ios-repository-pattern-in-swift-85a8c62bf436) to in order to have a single source of truth for all the info used in the application. 

The following image is an illustration of the separation of layers and how a repository may interact with the rest of components of the app.
